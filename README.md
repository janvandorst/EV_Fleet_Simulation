# EVsimulation
The Emobpy library is used to create a model which can generate EV profiles (EV_profile_generation.py) to built up a database. 
After a database is created, a fleet can be created (Fleet_creation.py) followed by some possibly analysis that can be performed on the outputs (Fleet_analysis). In this case the analysis consist of analyzing the charging demand and availability of the EV fleet. 
Two Jupyter notebooks are also included to explain the working of the model. 
For more indepth information about the used Emobpy library (including Jupyter notebooks) and an istallation guide I would like to reffer to: https://pypi.org/project/emobpy/
