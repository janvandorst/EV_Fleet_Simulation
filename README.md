# EV Fleet Simulation 
The Emobpy library is used to create a model which can generate mobility and charging profiles for electric vehicles (EV_profile_generation.py) to built up a database. \
After a database is created, a fleet can be created (Fleet_creation.py) followed by some possibly analysis that can be performed on the outputs (Fleet_analysis). In this case the analysis consist of analyzing the charging demand and availability of the EV fleet. \
Two Jupyter notebooks are also included to explain the working of the model. The config files, pre-created database and pre-created fleet can be used when completing the Jupyter notebooks.\
For more indepth information about the used Emobpy library (including Jupyter notebooks) and an istallation guide I would like to reffer to: https://pypi.org/project/emobpy/
