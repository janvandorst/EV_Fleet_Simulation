# EV Fleet Simulation 
The Emobpy library is used to create a model which can generate mobility and charging profiles for electric vehicles (EV_profile_generation.py) to built up a database. \
After a database is created, a fleet can be created (Fleet_creation.py) followed by some possibly analysis that can be performed on the outputs (Fleet_analysis). In this case the analysis consist of analyzing the charging demand and availability of the EV fleet. \
Two Jupyter notebooks are also included to explain the working of the model. The config files (config_files.zip), pre-created database (dbjup.zip) and pre-created fleets (Fleets.zip) can be used when completing the Jupyter notebooks. The pre-created database consists of 5 working and 5 inactive profiles for the Tesla model 3, Tesla model S, Renault Zoe and the Hyundai Kona. The pre-created fleet consists of three different fleets: Uncontrolled charging, Night charging and a combination of charging strategies.\
